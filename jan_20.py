"""
Lesson goal:
- Understand what an expression is
- Practice writing hard-coded expressions of different types
- Introduction to primitive data types:
    Integer
    Float 
    String (text)
    Boolean (True/False)
- Introduction to built-in functions: 
    print()
- Practice passing the value produced by an expression to the print function
  and printing it to the terminal
"""
# Live-coding starts here... For each task:
    # - use print() function 
    # - use hard-coded values inside the function
    # - what you see in parentheses () is an expression
    # - run code to see results in the terminal


# 1. Write an expression that evaluates to an integer.
# Pass it to the print function & print the result to the terminal.


# 2. Write an expression that evaluates to a float.
# Pass it to the print function & print the result to the terminal.


# 3. Write expressions with arithmetic operations
# (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
# Pass it to the print function & print the result to the terminal.


# 4. Write expressions to practice order precedence of arithmetic operations.
# Pass it to the print function & print the result to the terminal.


# 5. Write expressions that produce a letter F like shown.
# Pass it to the print function & print the result to the terminal.
# ********
# ********
# **
# **
# *****
# **
# **
# **


# 6. Write an expression, comparing numbers.
# This expression evaluates to a Boolean value.
# Pass it to the print function & print the result to the terminal.


# 7. Write an expression that evaluates to a string.
# Pass it to the print function.
# Print the result to the terminal.


# 8. Write an expression that concatenates a string and a numeric value into a string.
# Pass it to the print function & print the result to the terminal.
